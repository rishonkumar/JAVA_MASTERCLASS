CLASS
Class is a basically a blueprint for a house, using the blueprint we can build as many house
as we like based on those plans

Each house you build (in other words INSTANTIATE using the new operator) is an
object also know as an instance

Each house you build has an address(a physical location). In other words if you
want to tell someone where you live, you give them your address(prehaps written
on a peice of paper). This is known as reference

Keep in mind that in JAVA you have always have REFERENCES to an OBJECT in
memory, there is no way to access an object directly everything is done using
a reference

SUPER is used to access/call the parent class members
THIS is used to call the current class members. this is required when we have
a parameter with the same name as an instance variable(field).

METHOD OVERLOADING
providing tow or more separate method in a class with same name but different parameter
It reduce duplicated code
JAVA developers refer as compile time polymorphism
compiler decided which method is going to be called based on the method name,return ype and argument list

METHOD OVERIDING
Means defining a method in a child class that already exist in the parent class with same signature

By extending the parent class the child class gets all the methods defined in the parent class
(those mehtods are knows as derived methods)

know as runtime polymorphism coz the method that is going to be called is decided at runtime by the
JVM

STATIC METHODS
are declared using static modifier
cant access instance methods and instance vairables directly
We cant use this keyword
Main is static methods

INSTANCE METHODS
belong to an instance of a class
can access instance methods and variables directly
can access static methods and variable directly
To use instance method we have to instantiate the class first usually by using the NEW keyword
